![Windowed mode for VizArtist](title_vizrt_window.jpg "Windowed mode for VizArtist")

VizArtist have only fullscreen mode and it isn't usefull if you have only one monitor. Of cource you can have solution such as buying second monitor. Sometines you can't setup second monitor for some reason. Or you're using large screen and working with Artstis isn't comfortable or you want to have a refence near to working area.

I have reciept how to get around the issue:

1. Switch sceen resolution to smallest size (it will be size of Artist)
2. Start VizArtist and wait when loading screen appeared
3. After that (at any time) just turn back the resolution. Voila!
