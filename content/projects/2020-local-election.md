## Task

In 2020 was local election in Bosnia and Herzegovina and my client wanted to get a new style for election branding. It was an election across whole country separated for each municipality.

## Idea

I was inspired by country shape and image of transparent ballot box. Just take a look:

And, the title of the Election (placed inside the box) represents filled ballots:

## AR Elements

## Vizrt graphics

I've made an extended set of Vizrt graphics: 1) onscreen lower thirds and 2) AR elements for the studio.
