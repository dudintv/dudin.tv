## Task

I've designed a new graphical solution for re-branding of a TV news channel. This channel was bought by new owners and they would to change their image. Make it more modern and outstanding.

## Idea

After couple weeks researching I fount the perfect graphics idea for the brand. This is a combination of regular letter "A" (obvious part) and letter "A" from Morse code â€” this is "dot + dash".

This represent the idea "Broadcasting. From the beginning to modern". From Morse code to Social Networks.

## Design Solution

I've prepared static images of applying this style to real on-screen graphics. I've decided to align all middle lower-thirds to the center of the screen. And stick the geo-tag to this centered element.

This means "ATV":
