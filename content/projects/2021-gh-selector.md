## Task

My client needed to have an ability to select custom geometries from Vizrt Graphic Hub. Right into our complex remote control interface based on web-page.

## Idea

I've decided to make an universal Graphic Hub items selector (geom, images, etc). I used Javascript and Vue.js framework in order to make easy supportable tool for my client.

## Result

I've made a Vue.js component which can connect to Graphic Hub REST directly, retrieve all information and represent in simple and convenient interface.
