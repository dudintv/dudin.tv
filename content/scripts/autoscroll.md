This script for you if you need to scroll content with unpredictable size within screen. Target case is using in quote full frame graphics.

There are:
* padding inside-outside
* separate logic for small and large content. You can center small content and scroll large content
* creating scroll keyframes by hand or by action key
* setup start and duration by parameter. Convinient when you want to control duration from vcp-template

Animation from "0" to "100" and changing size of gabarits:
