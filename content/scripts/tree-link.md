### Interface description

__Source__ and __Target__ define "from" container and "to" container.

You can define what the script should do when you push __Make copy__: __Disable text link__, __Disable Autofollow__, __Delete animation__. It helps to avoid flickering.

Button __Make copy__ erases everything in __Target__ container and copy __Source__ container content into __Target__ container.

There are checkboxes to provide neat synchronization control. What you want to sync, and what you don't want: __Sync active__, __Sync position__, __Sync rotation__, __Sync scale__, __Sync alpha__, __Sync text__, __Sync rectangle__.
